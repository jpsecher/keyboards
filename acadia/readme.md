# Acadia keyboard

A custom built mechanical keyboard with just 38 keys plus two extra media keys.  It is a simplification of [Acacia](../acacia/).

The [layout](acadia.pdf) uses three layers.  One for alphas, one for navigation/function-keys, and one for symbols/numpad.

## Improvements

- Include a trackball.
- Make a proper (wooden) case.
